    <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a recipe for amazing BBQ ribs smoked by the All-Father himself.
        He picked this version up on a trip he took to Alabama in the seventies.
        It is known to being far superior to literally any BBQ ever produced 
        anywhere else on the planet.

        These ribs are smoky, sweet, and savory all in just the right amounts. They
        combine slow-cooking technique with a generous application of spices
        to bring out the flavors inherent to slow-smoked meat. Served daily to 
        dead Vikings in Valhala!
