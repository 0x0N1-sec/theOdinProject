    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a wonderful old-timey fried chicken cutlet recipe from the 
        Deep South.  It was handed down from my Great Great Great Grandpappy
        ("Ole' Reliable") to my Great Great Grandpappy ("Slightly Less Relibale")
        to my Great Grandpappy ("Yet even Un-Reliabler") to my Grandpappy ("All
        Reliability Now Gone") to my Pappy ("Frank") to me! 

        Now I am sharing with you the best main course you will ever make for 
        Sunday dinner after church (though I never did, I'm an vegan atheist you see)
        and it will keep all your church-going friends (I also have none of These
        as I am a vegan atheist) happy long after they've gone off to meet Ole' St.
        Peter at the Pearly Gates (though I don't believe they'll really be there because
        I'm a vegan atheist).
